# MedCare
This repo is an attempt to design and create a doctor-patient remote consultation and diagnosis system that will help doctors in their work to serve many patients and also help patients to gain access to affordable, quality health care near their homes.  
The system allows a patient in a medical consultation centre near their home to meet with a doctor in a top-level hospital and communicate remotely, get diagnois for common ailments and prescription online.
